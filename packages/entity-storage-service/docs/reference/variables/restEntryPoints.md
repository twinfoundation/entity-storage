# Variable: restEntryPoints

> `const` **restEntryPoints**: `IRestRouteEntryPoint`[]

These are dummy entry points for the entity storage service.
In reality your application would create its own entry points based on the
entity storage schema objects it wants to store, using a custom defaultBaseRoute.
